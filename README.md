# Prepping for the PMP exam

The Project Management Professional (PMP) is a certification aimed at the employed who lead projects small or big. The certificate is earned after attending a prep-course and passing an exam. The [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) is the issuing company.

## PMP Standards
The PMP wants to establish a standard for 
> most projects most of the time for many types of industries.

It is a collection of guidlines and rules as the basis of a globally recognized standard for project managers. The standard is defined in the *Project Management Body of Knowledge* (PMBOK Guide). 
The PMBOK Guide is no strikt compendium, rather a collection of *best practices*, which are divided into
+ 10 knowledge areas
+ 5 process groups 
+ 49 single processes

## What it is all about
There are 5 process groups which host the 49 different processes, which are organized in matrix form and are related 
to 10 knowledge areas.

| Process group 1  | Process group 2  | Process group 3  | Process group 4  | Process group 5  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Initiating  | Planning  | Executing  | Monitoring & Controlling  | Closing  |

Taking a closer look at the process groups reveals the underlying principle behind the PMP guidlines: Plan - Do - Check - Act  ([PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA)) or the Deming circle. The PDCA principle and it's derivatives are not only the basics of the PMP methodology, but when you add observations to it, it becomes the foundation of [lean management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) or the [Toyota production system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System).

[pdca]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/PDCA_Cycle.svg/1280px-PDCA_Cycle.svg.png "PDCA circle" 

The difference between the original idea behind PDCA and the PMP methodology is the add-on of the *initiating* and *closing* groups.

## Project 
Adding starting and stopping process groups to the original plan-do-check-act workflow goes along with the standard definition of a project being 

> a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.

Every project has a defined start and end and between those marks it is planned, executed, monitored and controlled.
Why a project is initiated can be due to:
+ Market requirements
+ Customer requirements
+ Strategic requirements
+ Technological requirements
+ Legislative requirements
+ Ecological requirements
+ Social requirements

### Project deliverables
The above quote reveals another important aspect of projects: A project creates something and thus delivers this something in some way. Project deliverables can be a product (think a new car model), a service (a third-party opens a call-centre and offers its service as the customer support of the new car model) or a result. The latter might be only virtual, e.g. results of year-long research and development efforts or creatig the blueprints of the new car model, if you like. 

However, there is more to a succesfull project than simply creating the necessary deliverables. Moreover, a succesfull project conforms with the scope, time and cost budget. It satisfies contracts and reaches quality standards. Sometimes the project goals are hard facts like reaching financial goals measured in the *Net Present Value* or softer goals like reaching the acceptance of various stakeholders.

### Knowledge areas
The 10 *Knowledge Areas* are the (theoretical) sub-parts of each project. Think about it this way: A project needs a defined scope, which is worked on during a defined amount of time, not costing more than an expected amount of money. Adding in more complexity, the deliverables have to fullfil certain quality standards and so on and so forth. The more complex a project is, the more things need to be considered. Although, even small projects can demand working on all knowledge areas. The complexer the project, though, the complexer or more time-consuming each knowledge area will be.  

|| Knowledge Areas  | 
|---|---|
|1| Integration management |
|2| Scope management |
|3| Schedule management |
|4| Cost management |
|5| Quality management |
|6| Resource management |
|7| Communication management |
|8| Risk management |
|9| Procurement management |
|10| Stakeholder management |

### Project management
Effective project management will require knowledge, skills and the mastering of techniques or tools. With this set of skills the project-defining requirements can be identified and constraints (e.g. the [*Triple Constraint*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle),) can be balanced against each other. Along the life of the project, assumptions, which were necessary at the start of the projects, get verifyied and information gets more detailed. The project is *progressively elaborated*.

### Processes
A single process describes actions, whether they are connected or bi-directional, which are necessary to reach a defined goal.
On a high-level a process is defined by its *inputs*, *tools and techniques* and its *outputs*.
There are two main categories of processes:
+ *Project management processes*: Ensuring an efficient project workflow.
+ *Product-centred processes*: Defined by the product lifecylce and varying with the area of application.
Processes can be an input to another process. If all processes are worked through, the project is completed. 
Processes can be divided in sequential, parallel and iteractive schemes.

The PMP methodology defines 49 processes, ordered by *knowledge areas* and * process groups*:

| | Initiating  | Planning  | Executing  | Monitoring & Controlling  | Closing  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Integration management  | <ul><li>Develop project charter</li></ul>   |  <ul><li>Develop project management plan</li></ul> | <ul><li>Direct & manage project work</li><li>Manage project knowledge</li></ul>  | <ul><li>Monitor & control project work</li><li>Perform integrated change control</li></ul>  |  <ul><li>Closing project or phase</li></ul> |

### Phases
Project phases are sections within a project. They are usually depending on the product or the industry. Project phases are not to be confused with the *process groups*. Typically, phases are running in sequences, however, they might run in parallel. Normally, a phase ends with a phase gate at wich different deliverables are to be finished. The project is the sum of all phases. There are three main phase models:

![alt text][sequential]

[sequential]: ./assets/images/sequential.png
*Sequential process scheme*

![alt text][parallel]

[parallel]: ./assets/images/parallel.png
*Parallel process scheme*

![alt text][interactive]

[interactive]: ./assets/images/interactive.png
*Interactive process scheme*

In the sequential process scheme yo do one phase activity at the same time. The other two models *fast track* to certain extends. However, doing several things at the same time comes with some disadvantages:
+ Higher in risk, but faster
+ Higher possibility for re-work
+ Higher cost due to re-work
+ Lower quality, if re-work is not possible

### Classical projects vs. agile projects

| Classical projects   | Agile projects   |
|---|---|
| Command and control: Hierachical and centralized  | Community-driven problem solving in a dynamic manner  |
| Decision making and compromising happens during the planning phase  | Decision making early in the define phase  |
| Scope driven  | Budget driven (time or money)  |
| Project runs long term (months/years)  | Project lifetime smaller than 6 months  |
| Costs are not well defined  | Added-value clearly defined  |
| Waterfall model   | DMAIC: Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control  |
| Slow and costly reactions to change requests  | Change requests hardly possible due to the early definition of requirements in the define phase  |

### Project lifecycles
Lifecycles of a project are ranging from classical to agile and anywhere in between. In the end the project manager has to tailor the lifecyle to the project, the product and the company culture.

| Lifecycle name   | Description   |
|---|---|
| Predictive  | <ul><li>Defined scope, schedule, cost at the beginning</li><li>Plan-driven</li><li>Not flexible</li></ul>  |
| Iterative  | <ul><li>Defined as much as possible at the beginning</li><li>Change to the baseline of scope, schedule or cost as you go</li><li>Looping through and repeating project phases as required</li></ul> |
| Incremental  | <ul><li>Deliverables are small</li><li>Get feedback from the stakeholders for each deliverable</li><li>The final iteration combines all deliverables to the end product</li></ul>  |
| Adaptive  | <ul><li>Agile</li><li>change-driven</li><li>Scope will be set at the beginning of each iteration or project phase</li><li>Deliverables are small increments of the final product</li></ul>  |
|  Hybrid  | Any cobination of the above  |

## The bigger picture
Projects are a direct way of adding value to a company. A company, however, normally does not only deal with one type of projects. Similar projects need to be aligned and managed to create synergies and harmonization effects. A company typically combines similar projects to *programs*. The greater buisness goals are pooled together in *portfolios*, which are groups of programs or projects.

*Operations* are another term to distinguish from a project. Operations are ongoing. Production lines for example are operations. Modernizing a production line within six months, while keeping production up, would be a project.

### Business case
Writting up a business case forces the writer to make the case for the project. 
+ definition of the requirements that a company has
+ Lists the reasons for a project
+ Is used to authorize a project
+ Identifies key-stakeholder
+ Analyzes the market situation by means of different techniques (e.g. gap analysis, risk analysis)
+ Defines the scope of a project
+ Concludes the decision making

### Benefits management plan
The benefits management plan defines the benefits the added value, which a project will bring. It describes how and when the gains will be achieved. It lists the key performance indicators (e.g. ROI, EVA, NPV) to measure the benefits.
+ Target benefits
+ Strategic alignment
+ Schedule
+ Benefits owner
+ Assumptions
+ High-level risks

### The project is influenced!
There are two main branches of influences for any given project.
+ Enterprse environmental factors: Enterprise envirnonmental factors can be internal or external. Internal factors are:
    + Company strategy
    + Company structure
    + Company culture
    + Project management information system (PMIS)
External factors are: 
    - Applicable policies  
    - Market conditions
+ Organizational process assets: Organizational process assets are processes, procedures and guidlines. Further, it is the accumulated knowledge (e.g. lessons learned) of a company. It also can be a collection of templates to be used.
+ Organizational gouvernance frameworks:
    + Organizational structures: Roles, Hierechies, Procedures, Responsibilities which need guidance adn steering, which are data-driven and need feedback.
    + OGF steer the organization towards it's goals, controls and monitors risks adn improves the performance of the company.
    + Typical tasks:
        + Unity of command and unity of direction: Clearly define responsibilities
        + Optimizing the use of available resources
        + Making resources avaiailable in a timely manner

### Company organizations
There are three main organizations:
+ Functional organizations
+ Matrix organizations
+ Project-oriented organizations

The functional organization type is the least project-oriented structure. It is strictly hierachical with functional managers calling all shots. Project managers are not typical in those organizations or do not excercise much power.
+ Responisibilities of the PM: None/low
+ Power over resorces of the PM: None/low
+ Power over budget of the PM: None/low
+ PM as a full-time job: No

The matrix organization type is in-between project-oriented structures and functional ones. It is divided into three sub-groups: *weak, balanced and strong* matrix organizations.
Weak matrix:
+ Responisibilities of the PM: Limited
+ Power over resorces of the PM: Limited
+ Power over budget of the PM: None/low
+ PM as a full-time job: No

Balanced matrix:
+ Responisibilities of the PM: Shared with functional managers
+ Power over resorces of the PM: Shared with functional managers
+ Power over budget of the PM: Shared with functional managers
+ PM as a full-time job: Yes

Strong matrix:
+ Responisibilities of the PM: Very high
+ Power over resorces of the PM: Very high
+ Power over budget of the PM: Very high
+ PM as a full-time job: Yes

The project-oriented organization type is absolutely project-centered. Teams are organized around projects and will be mixed anew for the next project.
+ Responisibilities of the PM: Full
+ Power over resorces of the PM: Full
+ Power over budget of the PM: Full
+ PM as a full-time job: Yes

Small companies may be heavily influenced by the owner. The structure of the company is more *organic* rather than one of the former three catecgories. In organic companies, the budget decisions are made by the company owner and the project manager has changing projects and responsibilities.

Each organization type has specific advantages and disadvantages.
Functional organisation:
+ Advantages:
    + Hierachies are well defined and comprehensible for the employees.
    + Carrer paths are well defined
    + Specialized carrer paths are possible
+ Disadvantages:
    + Project managers are not equiped with much power
    + There is competition for resources between different projects
    + The single members of a project team are loyal to their functional manager instead of the project manager
Matrix organization:
+ Advantages:
    + More control over ressources in a project
    + The project manager has increased authority
    + The PM can gain support for the project from functional managers
+ Disadvantages:
    + The PM has to balance project needs and the requirements of functional managers
    + Conflicts of interests can occure
    + The matrix organization increases the organizational complexity
Project-oriented organization:
+ Advantages:
    + The PM has full authority
    + Project communications are less complex
    + Employees are loyal to the project
+ Disadvantages:
    + Employees need another project after the previous project came to an end
    + Less optimal usage of resources

## Decision making
Coming to a conclusion is a difficult process. The complexer the problem, the harder is the decision making. In order to guide the decision making process, several indicators have been developed. The main purpose is to make a decision regarding between two or more projects, i.e. is it worth pursuing project A over B or the other way around.

### Compound interest
Central to the following calculations is is the factor for discounting future payments 

 n<sub>t</sub>(x) = 1 / (1 + i)<sup>t</sup>
 
 *i* being the discount rate
 
 *t* being the number of time periods (years/months) from now.
 
 Further, each period is represented by its balance of incoming cash flow, r<sub>t, in</sub>, and outgoing cash flow, r<sub>t, out</sub>, R<sub>t</sub>
 
 R<sub>t</sub> = r<sub>t, in</sub> - r<sub>t, out</sub>

### Discounted cash flow
The future value (or a series thereof) of a project will be represented in todays value. The problem is that the value of money changes over time. 

 The [Discounted Cash Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow) (DCF) is the sum over all of those future balances shifted to the present by the discount rate.
 
 DCF = &sum; R<sub>t</sub> / (1 + i)<sup>t</sup>
 
 The DCF calculates the value of future cash flows in todays money. The larger DCF project value will be chosen, when comparing two projects. Assume a discount rate, i, of 0.05
 
 DCF<sub>1</sub>  = 1,000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>1</sup> + 1,000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>2</sup> + 1,000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>3</sup>   
 
 DCF<sub>1</sub> = 1,000 * 0.9523 + 1,000 * 0.907 + 1,000 * 0.8638 = $2723
 
 Assume that the second project will not gain any benefits for the first two years, however, will incurre a benefit of $3000 in the third year.
 
 DCF<sub>2</sub> = 0 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>1</sup> + 0 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>2</sup> + 3,000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>3</sup>  
 
 DCF<sub>2</sub> = 0 + 0 + 3,000 * 0.8638 = $2591
 
 DCF of project 1 is larger than the DCF of project 2, thus, project 1 is to be chosen.

### Net present value
The [Net Present Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) (NPV) is an DCF calculation which takes the initial investment into account (see [this](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-difference-between-net-present-value-and-discounted-cash-flow) Quora answer as a reference). 
 
 Assume a discount rate, i, of 0.05 from the previous examples given in the DCF chapter.
 If the initial cost for a project (today, i.e. year zero) are $2,000 and the values for cash balance for the first year R<sub>1</sub> = 1,000 and for R<sub>2</sub> = 1,000 and R<sub>3</sub> = 1,000 then is the 
 
 NPV<sub>1</sub> = -2,000 + 1,000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>1</sup> + 1,000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>2</sup> + 1,000 / (1 + 0.05)<sup>3</sup>   
 
 NPV<sub>1</sub> = -2,000 + 1,000 * 0.9523 + 1,000 * 0.907 + 1,000 * 0.8638 = $723
 
 Assume that the initial investment for project 2 is only $1500. The respective NPV is then
 
 NPV = -1,500 + 3,000 * 0.8638 = $1091
 
 Considering the initial cost of an project may lead to other investment decisions. As the NPV of project 2 is larger than the one of project 1, project 2 is the more promissing project.

### Cost-benefit-analysis
The [cost-benefit-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) (CBA) (sometimes also calles benefit-cost-analysis) is used to make a decision based on the most beneficial cost of two projects.

In the simplest case, the CBA subtracts the cost of this year (year zero) from the benefit in this year. *Benefit* is an umbrella term for any money related surplus like revenue, net cash flow or net income. 

Comparing the following two projects with CBA will be resulting in chosing Project 2 over Project 1:

|Project | Benefit | Cost | CBA result | 
|---|---|---|---|
|1|$50,000|$40,000|$10,000|
|2|$35,000|$23,400|$11,600|

If benefits or costs are estimated to ocure in the future, the discount rate need to be applied on those. Assume that the costs are incurred today (year zero) and the benefits will incurre in the next year. Similar to the NPV, we will represent the values in todays money to make it comparable to Project 1.

 CBA<sub>Project1</sub> = 35,000 / (1 + 0.06)<sup>1</sup> - 23,400 / (1 + 0.06)<sup>0</sup> = $9,618.87
 
 In this case, Project 1 is favourable over Project 2.

### Internal rate of return
The [Internal Rate of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return) (IRR) calculates the discount rate *i* at which benefits and costs equal each other, i.e. the NPV is equal to zero. Therefore, a good investment is one with an discount rate above the IRR. The term internal highlights the fact that the IRR is not considering external factors like inflation. Those external factors are assumed to be equal for all projects under investigation and do not help in the decision making process at this time. 

NPV = &sum; R<sub>t</sub> / (1 + i)<sup>t</sup> = 0

This formula can only be solved numerically with methods like the [Newton-Raphson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) scheme. In order to estimate a solution, the regula-falsi-formula 

i<sub>RFF</sub> = i<sub>test1</sub> - NPV<sub>test1</sub> * ((i<sub>test2</sub> - i<sub>test1</sub>) / (NPV<sub>test2</sub> - NPV<sub>test1</sub>))

can be used.
The regula-falsi approach needs to test interest rates, which are given in the tables below. 
For the first test, a rate, i<sub>test1</sub>, of 0.04 is assumed.

|Year | Cash flow | DCF |  
|---|---|---|
|0|-$100,000|-$100,000 |
|1|$5,000|$4,807|
|2|$5,000|$97,078|

The DCF values and the initial investment are summed up to a NPV of $1886 for test 1.

For the second test, a rate, i<sub>test1</sub>, of 0.08 is assumed.

|Year | Cash flow | DCF |  
|---|---|---|
|0|-$100,000|-$100,000 |
|1|$5,000|$4,629|
|2|$5,000|$90,020|

The DCF values and the initial investment are summed up to a *negative* NPV of $5349 for test 2.

The regula-falsi-formula approximates the IRR accordingly:

i<sub>RFF</sub> = 0.04 - 1886 * ((0.08 - 0.04) / (-5349 - 1886)) = 0.05

### Return on investment
[Return on investmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment) (ROI) is the ration between net profit and invested capital. ROI is not dependent on the size of a project, thus, it can be used to compare different sized projects.
The larger the ROI the better. 

### Economic value added
The [Economic Value Added](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_value_added) (EVA) compares the net profits which the capital costs. Value is added if the net profits are larger than the costs. 

EVA = NOPAT - WACC * NOA

NOPAT - net operating profit after taxes

NOA - Net operating assets

WACC - Weighted average of capital costs

| | Period |  
|---|---|
|NOA|-$100,000|
|WACC|7 %|
|NOPAT|$8,000|
|EVA |$1,000 |

### Weighted scoring model
Weights are used to rank the influence of different factors. All factors together with their weights are summed-up to calculate a rating factor. The higher the rating factor the better the project. 
The sum of all weights is 100 %.
