# Prepping for the PMP exam

The Project Management Professional (PMP) is a certification aimed at the employed who lead projects small or big. The certificate is earned after attending a prep-course and passing an exam. The [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) is the issuing company.

## PMP Standards
The PMP wants to establish a standard for 
> most projects most of the time for many types of industries.

It is a collection of guidlines and rules as the basis of a globally recognized standard for project managers. The standard is defined in the *Project Management Body of Knowledge* (PMBOK Guide). 
The PMBOK Guide is no strikt compendium, rather a collection of *best practices*, which are divided into
+ 10 knowledge areas
+ 5 process groups 
+ 49 single processes

## What it is all about
There are 5 process groups which host the 49 different processes, which are organized in matrix form and are related 
to 10 knowledge areas.

| Process group 1  | Process group 2  | Process group 3  | Process group 4  | Process group 5  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Initiating  | Planning  | Executing  | Monitoring & Controlling  | Closing  |

Taking a closer look at the process groups reveals the underlying principle behind the PMP guidlines: Plan - Do - Check - Act  ([PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA)) or the Deming circle. The PDCA principle and it's derivatives are not only the basics of the PMP methodology, but when you add observations to it, it becomes the foundation of [lean management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) or the [Toyota production system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System).

The difference between the original idea behind PDCA and the PMP methodology is the add-on of the *initiating* and *closing* groups.

## Project 
Adding starting and stopping process groups to the original plan-do-check-act workflow goes along with the standard definition of a project being 

> a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.

Every project has a defined start and end and between those marks it is planned, executed, monitored and controlled.
Why a project is initiated can be due to:
+ Market requirements
+ Customer requirements
+ Strategic requirements
+ Technological requirements
+ Legislative requirements
+ Ecological requirements
+ Social requirements

### Project deliverables
The above quote reveals another important aspect of projects: A project creates something and thus delivers this something in some way. Project deliverables can be a product (think a new car model), a service (a third-party opens a call-centre and offers its service as the customer support of the new car model) or a result. The latter might be only virtual, e.g. results of year-long research and development efforts or creatig the blueprints of the new car model, if you like. 

However, there is more to a succesfull project than simply creating the necessary deliverables. Moreover, a succesfull project conforms with the scope, time and cost budget. It satisfies contracts and reaches quality standards. Sometimes the project goals are hard facts like reaching financial goals measured in the *Net Present Value* or softer goals like reaching the acceptance of various stakeholders.

### Knowledge areas
The 10 *Knowledge Areas* are the (theoretical) sub-parts of each project. Think about it this way: A project needs a defined scope, which is worked on during a defined amount of time, not costing more than an expected amount of money. Adding in more complexity, the deliverables have to fullfil certain quality standards and so on and so forth. The more complex a project is, the more things need to be considered. Although, even small projects can demand working on all knowledge areas. The complexer the project, though, the complexer or more time-consuming each knowledge area will be.  

|| Knowledge Areas  | 
|---|---|
|1| Integration management |
|2| Scope management |
|3| Schedule management |
|4| Cost management |
|5| Quality management |
|6| Resource management |
|7| Communication management |
|8| Risk management |
|9| Procurement management |
|10| Stakeholder management |

### Project management
Effective project management will require knowledge, skills and the mastering of techniques or tools. With this set of skills the project-defining requirements can be identified and constraints (e.g. the [*Triple Constraint*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle),) can be balanced against each other. Along the life of the project, assumptions, which were necessary at the start of the projects, get verifyied and information gets more detailed. The project is *progressively elaborated*.

### Processes
A single process describes actions, whether they are connected or bi-directional, which are necessary to reach a defined goal.
On a high-level a process is defined by its *inputs*, *tools and techniques* and its *outputs*.
There are two main categories of processes:
+ *Project management processes*: Ensuring an efficient project workflow.
+ *Product-centred processes*: Defined by the product lifecylce and varying with the area of application.
Processes can be an input to another process. If all processes are worked through, the project is completed. 
Processes can be divided in sequential, parallel and iteractive schemes.

In the sequential process scheme yo do one phase activity at the same time. The other two models *fast track* to certain extends. However, doing several things at the same time comes with some disadvantages:
+ Higher in risk, but faster
+ Higher possibility for re-work
+ Higher cost due to re-work
+ Lower quality, if re-work is not possible

### Classical projects vs. agile projects

| Classical projects   | Agile projects   |
|---|---|
| Command and control: Hierachical and centralized  | Community-driven problem solving in a dynamic manner  |
| Decision making and compromising happens during the planning phase  | Decision making early in the define phase  |
| Scope driven  | Budget driven (time or money)  |
| Project runs long term (months/years)  | Project lifetime smaller than 6 months  |
| Costs are not well defined  | Added-value clearly defined  |
| Waterfall model   | DMAIC: Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control  |
| Slow and costly reactions to change requests  | Change requests hardly possible due to the early definition of requirements in the define phase  |

### Project lifecycles
Lifecycles of a project are ranging from classical to agile and anywhere in between. In the end the project manager has to tailor the lifecyle to the project, the product and the company culture.

| Lifecycle name   | Description   |
|---|---|
| Predictive  | <ul><li>Defined scope, schedule, cost at the beginning</li><li>Plan-driven</li><li>Not flexible</li></ul>  |
| Iterative  |  |
| Incremental  |   |
| Adaptive  |   |
|  Hybrid  |   |
