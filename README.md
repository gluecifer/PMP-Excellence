# Prepping for the PMP exam

The Project Management Professional (PMP) is a certification aimed at the employed who lead projects small or big. The certificate is earned after attending a prep-course and passing an exam. The [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) is the issuing company.

## PMP Standards
The PMP wants to establish a standard for 
> most projects most of the time for many types of industries.

It is a collection of guidlines and rules as the basis of a globally recognized standard for project managers. The standard is defined in the *Project Management Body of Knowledge* (PMBOK Guide). 
The PMBOK Guide is no strikt compendium, rather a collection of *best practices*, which are divided into
+ 13 knowledge areas
+ 5 process groups 
+ 49 single processes

## What it is all about
There are 5 process groups which host the 49 different processes, which are organized in matrix form and are related 
to 13 knowledge areas.

| Process group 1  | Process group 2  | Process group 3  | Process group 4  | Process group 5  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Initiating  | Planning  | Executing  | Monitoring & Controlling  | Closing  |

Taking a closer look at the process groups reveals the underlying principle behind the PMP guidlines: Plan - Do - Check - Act  ([PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA))or the Deming circle. The PDCA principle and it's derivatives are not only the basics of the PMP methodology, but when you add observations to it, it becomes the foundation of [lean management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) or the [Toyota production system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System).
